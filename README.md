Universal Dictionary of Concepts
================================
Common U++ UNL dictionary

This is a multilingual pivot dictionary designed for various computer linguistic applications. An artificial language UNL (Universal Networking Language) is used as a neutral pivot to link words of different natural languages with each other. The basic units of the dictionary are "UNL concepts" or "Interlingual lexemes", which are usually equivalent to individual word senses. They are uniquely labeled with UNL "Universal Words" (UW). Each UW in the dictionary may be linked to one or several words in different natural languages (NL). 

For example, in order to translate an English word into Russian or French we should 1) get the list of its possible senses 2) choose one ore more senses, that we are interested in, and get the corresponding UWs 3) check what Russian/French words may be used to represent this sense.

The dictionary consists of several volumes, one for each language/orthography variant/dialect. An additional volume holds links between UWs.
Each NL volume contains links between words of some natural language and UNL UWs. It may also provide links to the dictionaries of computer systems used to convert NL text to UNL or deconvert UNL back to the NL. The idea is to enable continuous automated dictionary data exchange and synchronization between different systems that support UNL for the sake of interoperability. 
The UNL volume provides definitions of the UWs, and links to other semantic resources.
