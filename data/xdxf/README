This folder contained an XDXF rendering of the data. The old snapshot files have been deleted in 
anticipation of migrating to a different git provider. Large binary files should not be stored in 
a git repository and it is not possible to update them frequently due to technical limitations.
A perl script to convert current *.csv files to XDXF is offered instead. It should be run in console.

./csv2xdxf.pl csv

The resulting XDXF files can be used as-is or converted to other dictionary formats by makedict - 
a console tool found at https://github.com/soshial/xdxf_makedict or DictBuilder on a Mac


XDXF is a simple XML dictionary data interchange format supported by several GUI dictionary shells 
available for Linux, Windows, Android, etc. It can be used to lookup and browse the dictionary 
locally in a convenient way.

Compatible dictionary shells:
Goldendict  http://goldendict.org/    (Recommended)
Dicto  http://www.dicto.org.ru/
Alpus  http://ng-comp.com/alpus/index.html
XDclient  https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/xdclient/
