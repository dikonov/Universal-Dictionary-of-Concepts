This folder contained an XDXF rendering of the data. The old snapshot files have been deleted in anticipation of migrating to a different git provider.
Large binary files should not be stored in a git repository and it is not possible to update them frequently due to technical limitations.
A perl script to convert current *.csv files to XDXF is offered instead. It should be run in console.

./csv2xdxf.pl csv

The resulting XDXF files can be used as-is or converted to other dictionary formats by makedict - a console tool found at https://github.com/soshial/xdxf_makedict.


XDXF is a simple XML dictionary data interchange format supported by several GUI dictionary shells available for Linux, Windows, Android, etc.
It can be used to lookup and browse the dictionary locally in a convenient way.

Compatible dictionary shells:
Goldendict  http://goldendict.org/    (Recommended)
WiseDict  http://wise.sourceforge.net/
Atlantida  http://atla.revdanica.com/
