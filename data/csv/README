This folder contains the current public dictionary data as TAB separated text files (.csv).
All files are in UTF-8 encoding and may use Unix or Windows style line breaks.

This is the main format of the data. Other formats available are convertions from these .csv files. If you would like to contribute a patch to the dictionary data, please edit .csv files.

All unicode text editors and standard POSIX and GNU tools like diff, patch, grep, sort work well with csv. OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc is a good GUI tool to open them. Select "TAB" as the only column separator and leave text separator field (usually ["] ) empty.
